HOW TO BUILD
===================
This g2log is a snapshot from KjellKod repository. 
It contains what is needed to build example, unit test and performance test of g2log. 

If you want to integrate g2log in your own software you need the following files
g2log/src/
     g2log.cpp/h
     logworker.cpp/h
     privatelogworker.cpp/h

active_object_c++0x/src
      shared_queue.h
      active.h/cpp


BUILDING IT
-----------
cd g2log
mkdir build
cd build 
cmake ..
make



      
CONTENTS
===========================
3rdParty -- gtest, glog. 
-----------------------
Both are needed to compile the unit test and the logger comparison tests
gtest is included by the CMake and you don't need to do anything with it.
glog is not included and must be installed if you want to run the comparison tests

If you do NOT want to compile and run some tests, like the performance test, then you can always
just comment them away from the CMake configuration.


active-object_c++0x
--------------------
Is made with standard C++ components with the help of the latest C++0x and std::thread features (thanks to justthread). For more details
See www.kjellkod.cc/active-object-with-cpp0x. An example is provided


Good luck. Any questions? Contact me on my blog
